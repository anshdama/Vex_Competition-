# Vex_Competition


## Overview
This repository documents our participation in a VEX Robotics competition where our team designed, built, and programmed a competitive robot. The project involved 
mechanical design, electronics, programming, and performance optimization to meet strict competition requirements.  

The robot had to comply with the following constraints:  
- Maximum dimensions: 18" x 18" x 18"  
- Weight limit: 10 lbs   
- Task-specific design: must collect, lift, and deposit game pieces within a timed challenge  

The team placed 1st in the competition due to effective collaboration, iterative design improvements, and optimized autonomous performance.

## Contributions
- Mechanical & Electrical Design:  
  Co-designed the robot frame and mechanisms, ensuring compliance with size, weight, and power restrictions while maintaining structural stability. Iteratively improved arm, claw, and drive mechanisms to maximize speed and reliability.  

- Autonomous Programming:  
  Developed and programmed autonomous routines using sensor feedback for precise navigation and object manipulation. Collaborated with teammates to optimize the timing and sequence of actions for competition challenges.  

- Performance Tracking & Reporting: 
  Created weekly performance and efficiency reports documenting task completion times, energy consumption, and error rates. This data guided design improvements, resulting in a 50% increase in operational efficiency across the robot’s subsystems.  

- Team Collaboration & Strategy:  
  Participated in strategy sessions to define objectives for each match and coordinated responsibilities among team members—improved code integration and workflow by implementing proper documentation and version control standards.  

- Testing & Iteration:  
  Conducted systematic testing of drive systems, manipulators, and autonomous routines. Identified and resolved mechanical misalignments, electrical inconsistencies, and logic errors to improve reliability and repeatability under competition conditions.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Mechanical and electrical design under constraints
- Programming autonomous routines and sensor integration
- Data-driven performance analysis and iterative improvement
- Team collaboration, documentation, and workflow optimization

## Results & Impact
- The team achieved 1st place in the competition.  
- Autonomous routines improved task completion speed and reduced errors by a large margin.  
- Weekly performance reports and iterative improvements increased overall robot efficiency by 50%.  
- Improved collaboration and documentation practices enabled the team to integrate code and hardware changes 2x faster during build and testing cycles.
